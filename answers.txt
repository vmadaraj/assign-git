1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
- gitignore is used to determine the directories and files that git should ignore before the commit is done.
These includes file like .project, .class, .txt, .war etc these would be specific to the persons settings and 
will not work in the other systems so, these should be ignored before you commit them.

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
- Git does fast-forward when you merge a branch that is ahead of your checked-out branch.
This means to update the head pointer in a way that present value is direct descendent of prior value

3. Why should you have different branches?
- When you are working in team, everyone may work on different parts of the code, 
one may work on a different task and and you may need to test them individually first and test them together as well before you
merge them into main. This way you can work in parallel while not breaking the code and test and merge them as required.
 
4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
- One respository per project usually, it is easier to keep a track and you may create more branches as required.
